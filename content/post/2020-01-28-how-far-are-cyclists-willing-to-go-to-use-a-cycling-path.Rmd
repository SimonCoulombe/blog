I made a twitter survey a couple of weeks before the apocalypse to help me pick my next blog post topic and alll 3 members of the crowd overwhelmingly agreed that I should use bike gps data and graphhopper to find out how far cyclists are willing to go to use safer infrastructure.  



This is awesome, because I had been looking for a use for [this open data that contains GPS data for ~ 5000 bike trips in Montreal](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/trajets-individuels-velo-enregistre-mon-resovelo) for a while.

} else {trips <- qread(here::here("content/post/data/interim/bikegps/", "trips.qs"))
}
```


I came up with the following methodology:  

* Find out how many kilometers are spent on each road class for the *shortest path possible * between the origin and destination  (eg: 10 kilometers on residential roads).  
* Find out how many kilometers are *actually spent on each road class* (eg: 7 kilometers on residential roads, 6 kilometers on cycling pathways).
* The ratio between the kilometers increase in cycling pathway  and the kilometer decrease in less-safe roads defines how much cycling pathways are preferred over less-safe roads.  

In my example, the ratio is 2.0, as the cyclists are willing to do 6 kilometers on cycling pathways to reduce their residential road milage by 3.

This turned out to be quite an undertaking.  I have hit many snags, and I don't have an answer yet.  I dont think I ever will, but hopefully putting this in the open will help someone get started with graphhopper.    


# Code  

As usual, the code for this post is available on [github](https://github.com/SimonCoulombe/snippets/tree/master/content/post).  

# Data 

## Bike trip data  

We use [open data recorded](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/trajets-individuels-velo-enregistre-mon-resovelo) by the "Mon RésoVélo" app of the city of Montréal.   The JSON file includes around 5000 trips (4881 to be precise).  

It includes a linestring geometry depicting the path travelled,a column named "liste_segments_jsonb" giving the IDs of the segments travelled  (looks like the city did some mapmatching too) and the columns shown below:  
```{r}
trips %>% head(5) %>% glimpse
```

```{r}
mymap <- trips %>% 
  filter(id=="10044") %>%
  mapview(zcol ="id",
          color = colorblindr::palette_OkabeIto[1:nrow(.)]
  ) 


mapshot(mymap, file = here::here("static/post/2020-01-28-how-far-are-cyclists-willing-to-go-to-use-a-cycling-path", "original_bike_path.png"))

mymap
```



![](/post/2019-04-24-montreal-melting-pot_files/original_bike_path.png)

Since the map matching tool requires GPX files as input, we convert the linestring to multipoint, then export each trip to a gpx file name id_NNN.gps using the `pgirmess::writeGPX` function.  

```{r}

if (switch_generate_interim_data){
  
  # convert linestring to multipoints
  z <- trips %>% 
    mutate( 
      points = map(geometry, ~ {
        mls <- sf::st_cast(., "MULTIPOINT") 
        data.frame(id = "prout", x = mls[,1], y = mls[,2])
      }))
  
  # write each trip to a  a gpx bike names id_XXXX.gpx
  tic()
  furrr::future_walk2(z$id, z$points, ~ {
    pgirmess::writeGPX(.y, filename = here::here("content/post/data/interim/bikegps/", paste0("id_", .x, ".gpx" )), type = "t")
  }, progress= TRUE)
  toc() # 2 minutes on 7 cores
}
```



## OpenStreetMap data (road layout)

We download the latest openstreetmap  data for the province of Quebec from [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/quebec.html).


# A special tool : Graphhopper 

Graphhopper ([github](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) is an "open source routing engine".    It includes many tools/servers, and we will use the following two for this project:

* The [map matching program](https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching) is a command-line tool that takes a GPS path and returns a list of points "snapped" to the road.  
* The [routing engine](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) is a web service that returns the shortest path (with instruction) between two points.  It can be called using an API.  



## Map matching tool installation and use    


We will follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching) on the git repository, with a few changes:    

* We download the "recent_core" branch instead of master because it is required for the "vehicle=bike" option to work,  
* We import the road network for the province of Quebec instead of the city of Berlin.    

Note:  Java 8 and Maven >=3.3 are required.  


```
cd ~
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching.git --branch 'recent_core'
cd map-matching
mvn package -DskipTests
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/quebec-latest.osm.pbf --quiet
java -jar matching-web/target/graphhopper-map-matching-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar import quebec-latest.osm.pbf --vehicle='bike'
```

Once the quebec map has been imported into the mapmatching tool, we can invoke it from the command line  and ask it to map-match all the we put GPXs in the folder.  This takes about 10 minutes on my computer.  


```
cd ~/git/map-matching   
java -jar ~/git/map-matching/matching-web/target/graphhopper-map-matching-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar match ~/git/snippets/content/post/data/interim/bikegps/*.gpx
```
```{r}

if (switch_generate_interim_data){
  tic()
  system("cd ~/git/map-matching && java -jar ~/git/map-matching/matching-web/target/graphhopper-map-matching-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar match ~/git/snippets/content/post/data/interim/bikegps/*.gpx",  intern = TRUE)
  toc() # 591.865 sec elapsed
}
```



The resulting file is a bunch of files named id_NNN.gpx.res.gpx and the here is a comparison of the original trip with the map-matched trip.  


We matched 4858 / 4881  (99.5%) of the trips.  When this happened, we got an error that looked like this :

`Problem with file /home/simon/git/snippets/content/post/data/interim/bikegps/id_1035.gpx

Let's import these matched trips GPX back into R, and see how the map-matching did with our trip #10044

```{r import_mapmatchedtrips}

if (switch_generate_interim_data){
  # list trips ids that have been matched
  matched_liste <- tibble(filename =
                            list.files(path = here::here("content/post/data/interim/bikegps/"),
                                       pattern = "*.gpx.res.gpx")
  ) %>%
    mutate(id = str_extract(filename, "\\d+")) # 4859 matched trips
  
  
  matched <- matched_liste %>% select(id) %>%
    mutate(matched = future_map(id, ~{
      st_read(here::here("content/post/data/interim/bikegps/",paste0("id_", .x, ".gpx.res.gpx"))
              , layer = "track_points", quiet = TRUE)%>%
        mutate(group = .x) %>%
        group_by(group)%>%
        summarize(., do_union = FALSE) %>%
        st_cast("LINESTRING")
    }, progress = TRUE))
  
  matched_trips <- bind_rows_sf(matched$matched)
  
  qsave(matched_trips, here::here("content/post/data/interim/bikegps/", "matched_trips.qs"))
  
} else {matched_trips <- qread(here::here("content/post/data/interim/bikegps/", "matched_trips.qs"))
}

```


```{r map_trip_vs_matchedtrip}
original_and_matched <-
  bind_rows_sf(
    list(
      matched_trips %>%
        mutate(group = paste0(group, "_matched")),
      trips %>% select(group = id)
    )
  )

mapview(original_and_matched %>% filter(group %in% c("10044", "10044_matched")),
        layer.name= c("Origial trip vs  map-matched"),
        zcol = "group")
```


Its working fine!    As you can see, the 10044_matched trip  is matched to the  cycling lane on Rachel instead of the road.  This means the map matching algorithm really is using the "bike" vehicle option.  


## Routing tool installation  

Alright, now let's try to find what was the shortest route between the first and the last point.

The routing engine is not a command line tool like the map-matching tool, but a web server that can be called using an API.

I describe 3 ways to get it running below.  The easiest by far is you already have a docker hub account is to pull my image: morglum/graphhopper_quebec  .  

The graphhopper routing engine is located at https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper

We install it following [the quickstart guide for developpers](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/0.13/docs/core/quickstart-from-source.md), because the quickstart guide using a *.jar file (https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/0.13/docs/web/quickstart.md) returns an error when using the bike vehicle.

We replaced the including "config-example.yml" with my own [config-bike.yml](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/SimonCoulombe/c4e4bb3af45ba6b4ccdd48aab561b2dc/raw/config-bike.yml), shared as a gist.  The differences are as follow:  

  * replace `graph.flag_encoders: car`  with `graph.flag_encoders: bike, car`  ,  
  * add   
    `    - name: bike
    vehicle: bike
    weighting: fastest` under
    `profiles:
    - name: car
    vehicle: car
    weighting: fastest`    
  * add   `- profile: bike `  under   
    `profiles_ch:
    - profile: car`  


NOTE/QUESTION  :  I wasted a lot of time trying to get it with bike as the only available vehicle, to no avail.  It appears you can only add vehicles to "car", not replace car with another vehicle.   

### Installation (non-docker)


```
cd ~/git/
git clone git://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper.git
cd graphhopper
cd web/src/main/resources/ && ZFILE=/tmp/gh.jar && wget -O $ZFILE 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.graphhopper&a=graphhopper-web&v=LATEST' && unzip $ZFILE assets/js/main.js && rm $ZFILE && cd ../../../..
rm config-example.yml
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/SimonCoulombe/c4e4bb3af45ba6b4ccdd48aab561b2dc/raw/config-bike.yml
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/quebec-latest.osm.pbf --quiet
./graphhopper.sh -a web -i quebec-latest.osm.pbf  -c config-bike.yml
```



### Installation (create your own docker image)
This takes a while because it  needs to download osm data for quebec and build a cache for the network.  
```
cd ~/git/
git clone git://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper.git
cd graphhopper
rm config-example.yml
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/SimonCoulombe/c4e4bb3af45ba6b4ccdd48aab561b2dc/raw/config-bike.yml
mv config-bike.yml config-example.yml
rm Dockerfile
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/SimonCoulombe/ac4acfffdc5a4ac9a1a262703bfc5911/raw/Dockerfile # mon dockerfile utilise mon config et le québec
docker build -t morglum/graphhopper_quebec .
cd ~
mkdir docker_volumes
cd docker_volumes
mkdir graphhopper
docker run -d --name graphhopper -v ~/docker_volumes/graphhopper/data:/data -p 8989:8989 --restart unless-stopped graphhopper_quebec
```

### Installation (pull my docker image)
```
docker pull morglum/graphhopper_quebec
mkdir -p ~/docker_volumes/graphhopper/data
docker run -d --name graphhopper -v ~/docker_volumes/graphhopper/data:/data -p 8989:8989 --restart unless-stopped morglum/graphhopper_quebec
```

Once running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8989

## Routing tool API usage  

The documentation for the routing engine web api is found at https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/0.13/docs/web/api-doc.md  .  


Here is the JSON returned for a short route between two points near park in gatineau.  



```{r}
api_results <- fromJSON("http://localhost:8989/route?point=45.381271%2C-75.809054&point=45.380759%2C-75.82253&vehicle=bike&details=road_class&points_encoded=false")
api_results %>% str
```


```{r}
#api_results$paths$instructions %>% .[[1]] %>% select(distance)#%>% head(-1) # distances sur chacun des 3 segments
#api_results$paths$instructions %>% .[[1]] %>% select(interval) #%>% head(-1) # distances sur chacun des 3 segments
#api_results$paths$details$road_class[[1]][,3] # type de route correspondant aux distances
api_results$paths$points$coordinates[[1]] %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(lon = V1, lat= V2) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326) %>%
  mutate(group = "groupe") %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarize(., do_union = FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING") %>%
  mapview() # extraire les points du chemin le plus court
```

I find the following useful for my use case:

1 ) The "coordinates" columns gives us all the points in the path. There are 31 points.
```{r, echo = T}
api_results$paths$points$coordinates[[1]]
```

2)  "Instructions"  contains the text instruction your GPS would normally give you,  but also a "distance" travelled column (in meters) and an "interval" column telling us which points fit with which instructions.  
```{r, echo = T}
api_results$path$instructions[[1]]
```

In our example, the interval column indicates that the first instruction (continue onto Rue Lamoureux) is illustrated by the points 0 to 7, the second instruction (Keep right onto Sentier des Voyageurs Pathway) is illustrated by point 7-25 ... etc..


```{r, echo = T}
api_results$path$instructions[[1]]$interval
```

Finally, the "road class" column tells us that the points 0 to 7 are on a "residential" road, while points 7 to 25 are on a "cycleway".

```{r}
api_results$paths$details$road_class[[1]]
```





# Let's get some work done!  


## API functions   
First, I create some function to call the API from R  and wrangle the output  :  

```{r, echo = TRUE}
generate_api_call <- function(geometry, origin_destination_only = FALSE){
  
  if(origin_destination_only == FALSE){
    paste0(
      "http://localhost:8989/route?",
      st_coordinates(geometry) %>%
        as_tibble() %>%
        mutate(rownum = row_number(),
               random = runif(nrow(.)),
               rank = rank(random)) %>%
        filter(rownum == 1 | rownum == nrow(.) | rank < 250) %>%
        mutate(
          texte = paste0(
            "point=", Y, "%2C", X)
        )  %>% pull(texte) %>% paste(., collapse="&"),
      "&vehicle=bike&details=road_class&points_encoded=false"
    )
  } else if(origin_destination_only == TRUE){
    paste0(
      "http://localhost:8989/route?",
      st_coordinates(geometry) %>%
        as_tibble() %>%
        slice(1, n()) %>% # keep first and last coordinates
        mutate(rownum = row_number(),
               random = runif(nrow(.)),
               rank = rank(random)) %>%
        filter(rownum == 1 | rownum == nrow(.) | rank < 250) %>%
        mutate(
          texte = paste0(
            "point=", Y, "%2C", X)
        )  %>% pull(texte) %>% paste(., collapse="&"),
      "&vehicle=bike&details=road_class&points_encoded=false"
    )
    
  }
}

get_api_results <- function(geometry, origin_destination_only = FALSE){
  fromJSON(
    url(
      generate_api_call(geometry = geometry,
                        origin_destination_only = origin_destination_only)
    )
  )
}

get_routed_linestring <- function(api_results){
  api_results$paths$points$coordinates[[1]] %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    rename(lon = V1, lat= V2) %>%
    st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326) %>%
    summarize(., do_union = FALSE) %>%
    st_cast("LINESTRING")
}

get_distances_from_api_results <- function(api_results){
  tibble(
    distance = api_results$paths$instructions[[1]] %>% pull(distance),
    point_from = map(api_results$paths$instructions[[1]]$interval, ~ .x[1]) %>% unlist(),
    point_to   = map(api_results$paths$instructions[[1]]$interval, ~ .x[2]) %>% unlist(),
  )
}

get_road_classes_from_api_results <- function(api_results){
  tibble(
    from       = api_results$paths$details$road_class[[1]][,1], # from point
    to         = api_results$paths$details$road_class[[1]][,2], # to point
    road_class = api_results$paths$details$road_class[[1]][,3]  # type de route
  )
}

get_each_point_road_class_from_road_classes <- function(road_classes){
  road_classes %>%
    mutate(data = map2(as.numeric(from), as.numeric(to), ~ {
      data_frame(
        point_from =
          seq(
            from= .x,
            to = .y-1 ,
            by = 1
          ))
    })) %>% unnest(data) %>%
    select(-from, -to)
}


```

## Find the shortest paths  between origin and destination (and the distance travelled by road class.)

The code chunk below returns a table with a linestring showing the shortest route, a distance_by_road_class list_column with tibbles showing the distance in each road class for the tripp

TODO :. what about loops where origin = destination? length = 0... let's ditch them.
but all loops should be dropped as people obviously didnt take the shortest path..


```{r}
if (switch_generate_interim_data){
  ## graph origin and destination of all trips and ask the api for the shortest route.  
  shortest_route_temp <- matched_trips %>%
    mutate(
      api_results = future_map(geometry,
                               ~ get_api_results(geometry = .x,
                                                 origin_destination_only = TRUE), ## we  only pass the origin and destination to the api
                               progress = TRUE)
    )
  
  # - take all the points for the shortest route  and create a linestring, then re-add the api_results
  shortest_route_temp_linestrings <-
    future_map(shortest_route_temp$api_results, ~ get_routed_linestring(.x)) %>%
    bind_rows_sf() %>%
    add_column(group = shortest_route_temp$group,
               api_results = shortest_route_temp$api_results)  %>%

This is the content of "shortest route" for id 10044

Let's map the actual gps data, the map matched route and the shortest route together for id 56

```{r}


original_and_matched_and_shortest <-
  bind_rows_sf(
    list(
      matched_trips %>%
        mutate(group = paste0(group, "_matched")) %>% select(group),
      shortest_route %>%
        mutate(group = paste0(group, "_shortest"))%>% select(group),
      trips %>% select(group = id)%>% select(group)
    )
  )

mapview(original_and_matched_and_shortest %>% filter(group %in% c("56", "56_matched", "56_shortest")),
        layer.name= c("Origial trip vs  map-matched vs shortest (trip id = 56)"),
        zcol = "group")



```

## .. but we also need the **actual** distance travelled by road class !  

Here's something that kinda sucks : the map matching program returns a bunch of points, but it doesnt tell us the road class that was actually travelled.

Here is what we are going to do.  We are going to take  as many points as possible from the map-matched route and feed it to the routing API.  This will give us a distance travelled by road class and hopefully it wont be too borked.  

Some issues I got :  

- the fromJSON function falsely interprets long URLs as actual text return by an API.  To prevent this from happening, we can use the url() function inside the fromJSON function like this:   fromJSON(url(filesURL))  .  This idea was found [h]ere on github](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite/issues/230).    
- Firefox crashes when I give it URLs that are too long (error: URI too long), such as for id = 1015 which has around 400 matched points.  The cutoff appears to be somewhere around 275 points.  My fix is to keep a maximum of 250 random points (including origin and destination).

} 

```


It ... kinda works... but there are some random hiccups.  Look at our old friend 56 below
```{r}


original_and_matched_and_shortest_and_routed_matched <-
  bind_rows_sf(
    list(
      matched_trips %>%
        mutate(group = paste0(group, "_matched")) %>% select(group),
      shortest_route %>%
        mutate(group = paste0(group, "_shortest"))%>% select(group),
      routed_matched_trips %>%
        mutate(group = paste0(group, "_routed_matched"))%>% select(group),
      trips %>% select(group = id)%>% select(group)
    )
  )

mapview(original_and_matched_and_shortest_and_routed_matched %>% filter(group %in% c("56_matched",  "56_routed_matched")),
        layer.name= c("map matched vs routed-map-matched (trip id = 56)"),
        zcol = "group")


```

To compensate for these extra meters, we will apply the ratio between length(matched) and length(routed_matched) to the distance travelled in each road class.



# So .. the results  !  

Yeah.. there is some thinking to do here.  The travelled distance is much longer than the shortest possible distance because a lot of the trips are "loops".  This means that the travelled distance is longer than the shortest distance for all road classes and that we can't calculate a trade-off

Ah well, at least I learned to use graphhopper and got to publish my first docker image along the way.




```{r}


shortest_route%>% st_set_geometry(NULL)  %>% pull(distance_by_road_class) %>% bind_rows() %>% 
  group_by(road_class) %>%
  summarise(shortest_distance =sum(distance)) %>%
  left_join(
    routed_matched_trips %>% st_set_geometry(NULL)  %>% pull(distance_by_road_class) %>% bind_rows() %>% 
      group_by(road_class) %>%
      summarise(travelled_distance =sum(corrected_distance))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(diff = travelled_distance - shortest_distance) %>% 
  arrange(-travelled_distance) %>%
  knitr::kable( digits = 0L)

```
