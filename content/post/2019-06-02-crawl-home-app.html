<p>Drunks of the world rejoice, for today a centuries-old problem has been solved. I have created an app that will tell you the shortest path to your bed while stopping at N bars on the way. You can select you mode of transportation: walking, biking or driving.</p>
<p>Try it today by visiting my server at <a href="http://shiny.simoncoulombe.com/shiny/crawlhome/" class="uri">http://shiny.simoncoulombe.com/shiny/crawlhome/</a> using username <code>guest</code>and password <code>room</code>. Clicking “get me home” will have you hang for about 10 seconds before showing the map. More bars = more waiting time.</p>
<p>Origin and destination locations are geocoded using the <code>opencage</code> package. The pubs and their location between these two points are found using the <code>osmdata</code>package. The crawling/biking/driving duration between all the points is found using the <code>openrouteservice-r</code> package using a <code>ors_matrix</code> call . I then use a custom version of A* pathing I built to find the shortest path that will vist N bars on the way to my bed. The directions are then downloaded, from the <code>openrouteservice</code> API, this time using the <code>ors_directions</code> and finally mapped using <code>leaflet</code>. The code is <a href="https://github.com/SimonCoulombe/astarbar">available on github</a>.</p>
