There is a lot of talk in Canada about foreign speculators buying houses and appartments in Canadian cities  such as Vancouver and Toronto.  It mostly relies on hearsay as there is a huge lack of actual data.   I have been wondering what the situation looks like in Montreal.  

In this blog post, we will focus on properties that only include 1 dwelling on the tax roll.  My understanding is this includes houses and condominiums where each appartment belongs to a separate person, but excludes duplexes and triplexes where a single person owns all appartments.  

*Disclaimer:  I am not familiar with the real estate industry, I am just a guy messing with new data.*  

The data used is the same as was described earlier in my [Who owns Montreal](https://www.simoncoulombe.com/2019/09/who-owns-montreal/) post.  

```{r, echo=F, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(mapview)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau <- read_csv("data/raw/blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau.csv") %>%
  mutate(
   mailing_address_region= fct_relevel(factor(mailing_address_region), "Montreal", "Rest of Quebec", "Rest of Canada", "Outside Canada", "Missing postal address"))
blog_logements_solo_pour_carte <- read_rds("data/raw/blog_logements_solo_pour_carte.rds")
```

I found  `r paste0(blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>% tally(n) %>% pull(n) )` residential tax assessements related to a single dwelling, `r paste0(blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>% filter(meme_adresse == FALSE) %>% tally(n) %>% pull(n))` of which are registered to a different mailing address.  This means that `r paste0(round(100*blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>% filter(meme_adresse == FALSE) %>% tally(n) %>% pull(n) / 
  blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>% tally(n) %>% pull(n),1)) ` %  of appartments/houses are either "second homes" or used as investments (long term rental or airbnb) in Montreal.   
  
Does anyone know if this rate of 11.7%  is high or low?   I don't.  We need more #opendata.  
  
This rate peaks downtown, reaching 38 %, as shown on the following map :      

```{r}
blog_logements_solo_pour_cartez <- blog_logements_solo_pour_carte %>%  
  st_point_on_surface()


mymapview <-blog_logements_solo_pour_carte %>% 
  mapview(zcol="pct_same_address", layer.name = "Percentage of single-dwelling tax reports <br> whose owner live elsewhere <br> (includes condominiums)")

mymapview@map %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data=blog_logements_solo_pour_cartez ,
                   radius = ~20* sqrt(pieds_a_terre)/ sqrt(max(pieds_a_terre)), popup = ~ paste0(pieds_a_terre),
                   color = "red", fillColor = "red", fillOpacity = 1, opacity=1)

```

The next step is finding out what percentage of these "second homes/investments" are foreign owned.  We turn again to the mailing address and find that 3.6% of these addresses are located outside Canada.    

Again, I have no idea if this is high or low.  Note that this may be a gross under-estimation.  Foreign buyers could hire local agencies to manage their wealth, or create a local company to manage it.   

It is interesting to note that 75% of these non-lived-in homes are owned by owners who live on the island of Montreal (postal code starting with "H"). These are probably not second homes a few kilometers away from your real home but investments.



```{r}
pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned  <- blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>%
  filter(meme_adresse == FALSE, mailing_address_region != "Missing postal address")  %>% 
  group_by(mailing_address_region, SM13) %>%
  summarise(n_not_lived_in = sum(n)) %>%
  group_by(SM13) %>%
  summarise(pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned = 100*sum(n_not_lived_in * (mailing_address_region =="Outside Canada")) /    sum(n_not_lived_in)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(SM13, pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned)


blog_logements_solo_pour_carte %>% 
  inner_join(pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned) %>% 
   mapview(zcol="pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned", layer.name = "Percentage of not-lived-in dwellings <br> with mailing address outside Canada <br>")
  
```

```{r}
blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>%
  filter(meme_adresse == FALSE)  %>% 
  group_by(mailing_address_region) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(pct = 100* n / sum(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Foreign ownership of dwellings not lived in by owner in Montreal",
               digits=c(0,0,1),
               format.args = list(big.mark = " ")
               )
```



Overall this means that only 0.4 % of all homes (exluding plexes and rental appartments)   have a foreign mailing address in Montreal.  This peaks at 2.4% downtown.


```{r}
blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>%
  group_by(mailing_address_region) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(pct = 100* n / sum(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Foreign ownership of all dwellings  in Montreal",
               digits=c(0,0,1),
               format.args = list(big.mark = " ")
               )
```

```{r}
pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned  <- blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau %>%
  filter(mailing_address_region != "Missing postal address")  %>% 
  group_by(mailing_address_region, SM13) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  group_by(SM13) %>%
  summarise(pct_foreign_owned = 100*sum(n * (mailing_address_region =="Outside Canada")) /    sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(SM13, pct_foreign_owned)


blog_logements_solo_pour_carte %>% 
  inner_join(pct_not_lived_in_foreign_owned) %>% 
   mapview(zcol="pct_foreign_owned", layer.name = "Percentage of all dwellings <br> with mailing address outside Canada <br>")
  
```

That's it, have a nice day.  
# Appendix  

I have included a more detailed table including the sector of the appartments and the status of the owner (physical or moral) shown below for the enthusiast.  

```{r}

blog_logements_solo_pour_tableau  %>%
  group_by(meme_adresse, mailing_address_region, statut1) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
    knitr::kable(caption = "Counts of all single-dwellings in Montreal by 'same mailing address as building address' status,  mailing address region, owner status",
               digits=c(0,0,0,0,0,0),
               format.args = list(big.mark = " ")
               )


```
