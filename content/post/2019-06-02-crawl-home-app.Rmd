Drunks of the world rejoice, for today a centuries-old problem has been solved.   I have created an app that will tell you the shortest path to your bed while stopping at N bars on the way.  You can select you mode of transportation: walking, biking or driving.   

Try it today by visiting my server at  http://shiny.simoncoulombe.com/shiny/crawlhome/ using username `guest`and password `room`.  Clicking "get me home" will have you hang for about 10 seconds before showing the map.  More bars = more waiting time.  


The list of pubs and their location is found using the `osmdata`package and the crawling/biking/driving duration between the points is found using the `openrouteservice-r` package using a `ors_matrix` call .  I then use a custom version of A* pathing I built to find the shortest path that will vist N bars on the way to my bed.  The directions are then downloaded, again from the `openrouteservice`  API, this time using the `ors_directions` .   The code is [available on github](https://github.com/SimonCoulombe/astarbar).
